# E2E Test Configuration
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml and fill in your values.
# config.yaml is git-ignored and should contain your actual credentials.
#
# Usage:
#   cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
#   # Edit config.yaml with your server credentials
#   go test -v -tags e2e ./e2e/...

# Test mode: "local" or "production"
# - local: Tests run against `make dev` cluster on localhost
# - production: Tests run against real VPS servers
mode: local

# Base domain for deployment routing
# - Local: orama.network (default)
# - Production: dbrs.space (or your custom domain)
base_domain: orama.network

# Production servers (only used when mode=production)
# Add your VPS servers here with their credentials
servers:
  # Example:
  # - name: vps-1
  #   ip: 1.2.3.4
  #   user: ubuntu
  #   password: "your-password-here"
  #   is_nameserver: true
  # - name: vps-2
  #   ip: 5.6.7.8
  #   user: ubuntu
  #   password: "another-password"
  #   is_nameserver: false

# Nameserver hostnames (for DNS tests in production)
# These should match your NS records
nameservers:
  # Example:
  # - ns1.yourdomain.com
  # - ns2.yourdomain.com

# API key for production testing
# Leave empty to auto-discover from RQLite or create fresh key

## Abstract

We propose a decentralized ecosystem, the DeBros Network, enabling peer-to-peer application deployment and operation across a global network of nodes, free from centralized control. Built with Go and LibP2P for robust networking, RQLite for distributed consensus, and integrated with the Solana blockchain for identity and governance, the network provides a resilient, privacy-first platform for decentralized applications. Participation is governed by NFT ownership and token staking, with demonstrated applications like Anchat showcasing real-world messaging capabilities. The architecture eliminates single points of failure while maintaining developer simplicity and end-user accessibility.

## 1. Introduction

Centralized systems dominate modern technology, imposing control over data, access, and development through single points of failure and intermediaries. These structures compromise privacy, resilience, innovation, and freedom, while existing decentralized solutions often lack the simplicity or scalability needed for widespread adoption.

The DeBros Network resolves these issues by establishing a peer-to-peer platform where nodes form a decentralized backbone for applications. Built on Go's performance and LibP2P's proven networking stack, it empowers a global community of developers and users to collaborate as equals, delivering scalable, privacy-first solutions without centralized oversight.

## 2. Problem Statement

Centralized application platforms introduce critical vulnerabilities:

- **Data breaches** through single points of failure
- **Censorship** and restricted access by gatekeeping authorities
- **Limited development access** controlled by platform owners
- **Privacy erosion** through centralized data collection
- **Vendor lock-in** preventing migration and innovation

Existing blockchain-based alternatives prioritize financial systems over general-purpose application hosting, leaving a gap for a decentralized, developer-friendly infrastructure that balances scalability, performance, and accessibility.

## 3. Solution Architecture

The DeBros Network is a decentralized system where nodes, built with Go and running on various platforms, collaboratively host and serve applications through a distributed database layer. The architecture eliminates central authorities by distributing control across participants via cryptographic mechanisms and consensus protocols.

### 3.1 Core Components

**Network Layer:**

- **LibP2P**: Peer-to-peer communication and discovery

- **Bootstrap nodes**: Network entry points for peer discovery
- **Auto-discovery**: Dynamic peer finding and connection management

**Database Layer:**

- **RQLite**: Distributed SQLite with Raft consensus
- **Consensus**: Automatic leader election and data replication
- **Isolation**: Application-specific database namespaces
- **ACID compliance**: Strong consistency guarantees

**Application Layer:**

# Orama Vault -- Architecture

## What is Orama Vault?

Orama Vault is a distributed secrets store. It runs as a guardian daemon (`vault-guardian`) on every node in the Orama Network. The guardian protocol is share-at-a-time: a direct client splits locally and pushes one share per guardian, then reconstructs locally on pull.

Production HTTP clients go through the **Orama gateway**, which is not a reverse-proxy of those endpoints. The gateway splits on store and combines on retrieve, so that process holds the full secret in RAM for the request.

The system provides information-theoretic security: compromising fewer than K guardians reveals zero information about the original secret. This is not computational security -- it is mathematically impossible to learn anything from K-1 shares, regardless of computing power.

## How It Fits Into Orama Network

```
                         Orama Network Node
    +------------------------------------------------------------+
    |  orama-gateway (port 443)                                  |
    |    |                                                       |
    |    +-- vault proxy (split/combine in-process) --> vault-guardian :7500 |
    |                          vault-guardian (port 7501, peer)   |
    |                                                            |
    |  RQLite (port 4001) -- cluster membership source of truth  |
    |  Olric  (port 10003) -- distributed cache                  |
    |  WireGuard (10.0.0.x) -- encrypted overlay network         |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Every Orama node runs a `vault-guardian` process alongside the gateway, RQLite, and Olric. The guardian:

- Listens on **port 7500** for client HTTP requests (V1 push/pull shares, V2 CRUD secrets).
- Reserves **port 7501** for the guardian-to-guardian binary protocol (heartbeat, verify, repair), restricted to the WireGuard overlay network. The protocol is implemented, but the peer listener is not yet started by the daemon -- nothing accepts connections on 7501 in v0.1.0.
- Will discover peers via RQLite (the cluster's membership source of truth). The RQLite fetch is currently a stub that returns an empty node list, so each guardian effectively runs single-node today.

## Data Flow

### V1 Push (Backup)

```
Client                     Guardian-1        Guardian-2        Guardian-N
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |-- POST /v1/vault/push --> [store share.bin]  |                 |
  |-- POST /v1/vault/push ------------------> [store share.bin]   |
  |-- POST /v1/vault/push -------------------------------------> [store]
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |<--- {"status":"stored"} ---|                 |                 |
```

1. Client generates encrypted key material (DEK-wrapped secret, KEK1/KEK2 wrapped DEKs).
2. Client runs Shamir split locally: secret -> N shares with threshold K.
3. Client pushes each share to a different guardian via `POST /v1/vault/push` (session token + Ed25519 ownership proof required).
4. Each guardian stores the share atomically to disk (temp file + rename).
5. Each guardian writes the monotonic version (plus threshold) to `meta.json` last, as the commit marker, for anti-rollback protection.

### V1 Pull (Recovery)

```
Client                     Guardian-1        Guardian-2        Guardian-K
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |-- POST /v1/vault/pull --> [read share.bin]   |                 |
  |<-- {"share":"<base64>"} ---|                 |                 |
  |-- POST /v1/vault/pull ------------------> [read share.bin]    |
  |<-- {"share":"<base64>"} ------------------|                    |
  |     ...collect K shares...                                     |
  |                                                                |
  [Lagrange interpolation at x=0 -> reconstruct secret]
```

1. Client contacts guardians and requests its share via `POST /v1/vault/pull`.
2. Each guardian reads the share from disk and returns it base64-encoded.
3. Client collects at least K shares and reconstructs the secret via Lagrange interpolation over GF(2^8).

### V2 Store (Named Secret)

```
Client                     Guardian-1        Guardian-2        Guardian-N
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |-- auth/challenge -------->|                 |                 |
  |<-- {nonce,tag} -----------|                 |                 |
  |-- auth/session ---------->|                 |                 |
  |<-- {identity,expiry_ns,tag} (client assembles token)          |
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |  [Shamir split: secret -> N shares]                           |
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |-- PUT /v2/vault/secrets/my-key ------------> [store share]    |
  |   X-Session-Token: <tok>   |                 |                 |
  |-- PUT /v2/vault/secrets/my-key --> [store]   |                 |
  |-- PUT /v2/vault/secrets/my-key -----------------------------> [store]
  |                            |                 |                 |
  |<-- {"status":"stored"} ---|                 |                 |
```

1. Client authenticates with each guardian (challenge-response).
2. Client runs Shamir split locally: secret -> N shares with threshold K.
3. Client pushes each share to a different guardian via `PUT /v2/vault/secrets/{name}` with `X-Session-Token` header.
4. Each guardian extracts identity from the session token and stores the share under `<data_dir>/vaults/<identity>/<name>/`.
5. Anti-rollback: version must be strictly greater than the stored version.

### V2 Retrieve (Named Secret)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why File-Per-User Storage (Not a Database)

Each user's share is stored as a plain file. In V1 the layout is `<data_dir>/shares/<identity_hash>/share.bin`. In V2 the layout is `<data_dir>/vaults/<identity_hex>/<secret_name>/`. This design was chosen because:

1. **No external dependencies.** The guardian binary is fully self-contained. No PostgreSQL, SQLite, or RQLite dependency for storage.
2. **Atomic writes.** The write-to-temp + rename pattern guarantees that a share is either fully written or not at all. No partial writes, no journal corruption.
3. **Simple backup.** The entire data directory can be backed up with rsync or tar.
4. **Predictable performance.** No query planning, no lock contention, no WAL growth. Each operation is a single file read or write.
5. **Natural sharding.** Files are already sharded by identity hash. No rebalancing needed.

### Storage Layouts

**V1 (Single Share per Identity):**

```
<data_dir>/shares/<identity_hash_hex>/
    share.bin          -- Raw encrypted share data
    share.bin.tmp      -- Temp file during atomic write
    checksum.bin       -- HMAC-SHA256 integrity checksum
    meta.json          -- {"version":<n>,"threshold":<k>} (anti-rollback + reconstruction params)
    wrapped_dek1.bin   -- KEK1-wrapped DEK (Phase 2)
    wrapped_dek2.bin   -- KEK2-wrapped DEK (Phase 2)
```

`meta.json` is written last, as the commit marker: the share only counts as present once it lands, giving crash-consistency across the multi-file write. The guardian also keeps a persistent at-rest integrity key at `<data_dir>/integrity.key` (created on first run, 0600 permissions) that keys the HMAC over stored share files so they survive restarts.

**V2 (Generic Secrets):**

```
<data_dir>/vaults/<identity_hex>/<secret_name>/
    share.bin     -- Encrypted share data
    checksum.bin  -- HMAC-SHA256 integrity checksum
    meta.json     -- {"version":1,"created_ns":...,"updated_ns":...,"size":123}
```

V2 supports up to 1000 named secrets per identity, each up to 512 KiB. Secret names are restricted to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` and max 128 characters.

### Why GF(2^8)

Shamir's Secret Sharing operates over a finite field. We use GF(2^8) -- the Galois field with 256 elements -- because:

1. **Byte-aligned.** Each field element is exactly one byte. No encoding overhead, no bignum arithmetic.
2. **Same field as AES.** GF(2^8) with irreducible polynomial x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 (0x11B) is the same field used by AES. Well-studied, well-understood.
3. **Fast arithmetic.** Precomputed log/exp tables (generated at comptime in Zig) give O(1) multiplication, inversion, and division with zero runtime cost.
4. **255 nonzero elements.** Supports up to 255 shares (evaluation points x=1..255), which is more than sufficient for the Orama network (up to ~100 nodes per environment).

Addition and subtraction in GF(2^8) are both XOR. Multiplication uses log/exp table lookups. Division uses `a / b = a * inv(b)` where `inv(a) = exp[255 - log[a]]`.

### Why All-Node Replication

Every guardian stores one share per user. In a 14-node cluster, each user has 14 shares with an adaptive threshold K = max(2, floor(N/3)). This means:

- With 5 nodes: K=2, so any 2 guardians can reconstruct.
- With 14 nodes: K=4, so any 4 guardians can reconstruct.
- With 100 nodes: K=33, so any 33 guardians can reconstruct.
- Up to N-K nodes can be completely destroyed before data is lost.

All-node replication was chosen because:

1. **Maximum fault tolerance.** The more shares that exist, the more nodes can fail.
2. **Simple push logic.** Client pushes to all nodes, no routing or placement decisions.
3. **Low per-share cost.** Each share is the same size as the original secret (~1KB typically). Even at 100 nodes, total storage per user is ~100KB.

## Guardian Lifecycle

### Startup

1. Parse CLI arguments and load config from the config file (key=value format; defaults if the file does not exist).
2. Ensure the data directory exists.
3. Generate a random 32-byte server secret (for HMAC-based auth) and load or create the persistent at-rest integrity key (`<data_dir>/integrity.key`).
4. Fetch node list from RQLite -- currently a stub that returns an empty list, so the guardian runs with no known peers.
5. Mark self as alive in the node list (only when the list is non-empty).
6. Count existing shares on disk.
7. Start the heartbeat-send thread, then the HTTP server on port 7500 (blocks in accept loop).

### Heartbeat

The peer protocol targets port 7501 (WireGuard-only). Every 5 seconds, a background thread sends a heartbeat to all known peers. Note that the peer *listener* is not yet wired into the daemon, so heartbeats are currently sent but never received -- and with RQLite discovery stubbed there are no known peers to send to anyway. The heartbeat includes:

- Sender IP (4 bytes, WireGuard address)
- Sender port (2 bytes)
- Share count (4 bytes)
- Timestamp (8 bytes, Unix seconds)

Peer state transitions:

```
            5s heartbeat received
unknown  --------------------------> alive
alive    --- no heartbeat for 15s -> suspect
suspect  --- no heartbeat for 60s -> dead
dead     --- heartbeat received ---> alive
```

### Verify

Periodic verification ensures share integrity across guardians (part of the not-yet-wired peer protocol). A guardian:

1. Selects a share and computes its SHA-256 hash (commitment root).
2. Sends a `verify_request` to a peer with the identity hash.
3. The peer reads its copy, computes SHA-256, and sends a `verify_response`.
4. The initiator compares commitment roots. Mismatch indicates tampering or corruption.

### Repair (Proactive Re-sharing)

> **Status:** The repair/reshare modules are implemented and unit-tested but not yet wired into the running daemon -- no runtime code triggers re-sharing today.

When the cluster topology changes (node join/leave) or every 24 hours, the repair protocol is designed to refresh all shares using the Herzberg-Jarecki-Krawczyk-Yung protocol:

1. Leader broadcasts `repair_offer` to all guardians.
2. Each guardian generates a random polynomial q_i(x) of degree K-1 with q_i(0)=0.
3. Guardian i sends q_i(j) to guardian j for all j.
4. Each guardian computes: `new_share = old_share + sum(received deltas)` over GF(2^8).
5. Guardians exchange new Merkle commitments to verify consistency.

The secret is preserved because `sum(q_i(0)) = 0`. Old shares become algebraically independent from new shares, so compromising old shares provides zero information about the current secret.

Repair triggers:
- Node topology change detected (join or departure)
- Periodic timer (every 24 hours)
- Manual admin trigger (Phase 2)

Safety requirement: at least 3 alive guardians to initiate repair.

### Shutdown

On shutdown, the in-memory server secret and integrity key are both zeroed (`@memset`). Share data on disk -- and the persistent `integrity.key` file -- survive restarts.

## Recovery Paths

### Path A: Mnemonic Recovery

The user has their BIP-39 mnemonic phrase. They derive the root seed locally and use it to decrypt the vault contents. No guardian interaction needed -- the guardians only store encrypted shares as an additional backup.

### Path B: Username + Passphrase Recovery

The user does not have their mnemonic but remembers their username and passphrase. The recovery flow:

1. Client derives identity hash from username (SHA-256 of identity).
2. Client contacts guardians and pulls K shares via `POST /v1/vault/pull`.
3. Client reconstructs the encrypted blob via Lagrange interpolation.
4. Client derives the decryption key from the passphrase (via HKDF).
5. Client decrypts the blob to recover the root seed/mnemonic.

This path depends on the key wrapping scheme (DEK encrypted by KEK1 from mnemonic, KEK2 from passphrase). The dual-KEK design ensures either recovery path works independently.

## Protocol Versions

- **Protocol version 1** (current): 6-byte wire header `[version:1][type:1][length:4]`, big-endian length, TCP transport on port 7501.
- **Binary v0.1.0**: MVP with single-threaded HTTP server, file-per-user storage, HMAC-based auth, stub post-quantum crypto.

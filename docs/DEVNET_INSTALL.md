# Installing a Devnet Cluster

Anyone is installed as a **client** on every node by default (SOCKS5 on `:9050`
for `/v1/proxy/anon`). There is no relay/ORPort mode.

A single VPS (index + one tenant, not HA) is [EVAL.md](EVAL.md). This page is
the three-nameserver cluster path.

**Note:** Store credentials securely (not in version control).

## Installation Order

Install nodes **one at a time**, waiting for each to complete before starting
the next:

1. ns1 (genesis nameserver)
2. ns2 (nameserver)
3. ns3 (nameserver)
4. Additional workers as needed (no `--role nameserver`)

---

## The path: `orama node setup`

One command per node, from your own machine. It creates an SSH key in
RootWallet, installs it on the VPS, uploads the binary archive, mints an invite
where one is needed, and runs the install. You never SSH in yourself.

It needs an unlocked RootWallet.

```bash
# ns1 — genesis nameserver, creates the cluster
orama node setup --ip <ns1-ip> --password '<vps-pass>' --env devnet \
  --base-domain <your-domain.com> --role nameserver --genesis

# ns2 / ns3 — join as nameservers
orama node setup --ip <ns-ip> --password '<vps-pass>' --env devnet \
  --base-domain <your-domain.com> --role nameserver

# Worker — domain is auto-generated, e.g. node-a3f8k2.<your-domain.com>
orama node setup --ip <node-ip> --password '<vps-pass>' --env devnet \
  --base-domain <your-domain.com>
```

Pass `--host-key SHA256:...` to pin the VPS host key instead of confirming it
interactively.

---

## Appendix: installing by hand

Use this when `orama node setup` cannot be used — no RootWallet, or a VPS you
reach some other way. It does the same thing with more steps.

### 1. Mint an invite (not needed for the genesis node)

From your own machine:

```bash
orama invite --expiry 24h
```

Or from an existing node:

```bash
sudo orama node invite --expiry 24h
```

Either prints one string. It carries the gateway to join **and** the
fingerprint of that gateway's TLS certificate, which the joining node pins
instead of trusting whatever certificate it is first shown. There is nothing
else to copy across, and nothing to get the wrong way round.

Invites are **single-use**. Mint one per join.

### 2. Genesis node

```bash
# SSH: <user>@<ns1-ip>

sudo orama node install \
  --vps-ip <ns1-ip> \
  --domain <your-domain.com> \
  --base-domain <your-domain.com> \
  --nameserver
```

### 3. Joining nodes

```bash
# SSH: <user>@<ns-ip>

sudo orama node install \
  --token <INVITE> \
  --vps-ip <ns-ip> \
  --domain <your-domain.com> \
  --base-domain <your-domain.com> \
  --nameserver
```

A worker is the same without `--nameserver` and without `--domain`; the domain
is auto-generated.

Or drive it from your own machine over SSH:

```bash
orama node install --remote --token <INVITE> \
  --vps-ip <node-ip> --base-domain <your-domain.com>
```

`--remote` is required to install a machine other than the one you are on. It
used to be inferred from whether you had used sudo, so the same command line
meant two different things on two different machines.

## Verification

`orama node install` verifies the node itself before printing `✅` — supervisor active and not crash-looping, rqlite in `Leader`/`Follower`, `wg0` up, gateway `/health` 200 — and exits non-zero naming the first component that did not come up. A successful install therefore already means the node works; the checks below verify the **cluster**.

After all nodes are installed, verify cluster health:

```bash
# Full cluster report (from local machine)
./bin/orama monitor report --env devnet

# Single node health
./bin/orama monitor report --env devnet --node <ip>

# Or manually from any VPS:
curl -s http://localhost:10100/status | jq -r '.store.raft.state, .store.raft.num_peers'
curl -s http://localhost:10104/health
systemctl status orama-anyone-client
```

# Common Problems & Solutions

Troubleshooting guide for known issues in the Orama Network.

## 1. Namespace Gateway: "Olric unavailable"

> **First, check whether this is drift the reconciler has already fixed.** When
> a namespace member is replaced, the survivors used to keep the departed node's
> overlay address in `configs/olric-<node>.yaml` peers and `configs/gateway-<node>.yaml`
> `olric_servers` for ever — nothing rewrote them, so every gateway restart
> stalled for minutes timing out against a machine that was gone. The tenant
> reconciler now rewrites both within 60s of the membership changing, and
> restarts the service only when the config actually differs. If the config
> still names a node that is gone, the reconciler is not running or not
> converging; that is the bug, not the config.

**Symptom:** `ns-<name>.orama-devnet.network/v1/health` returns `"olric": {"status": "unavailable"}`.

**Cause:** The Olric memberlist gossip between namespace nodes is broken. Olric uses UDP pings for health checks — if those fail, the cluster can't bootstrap and the gateway reports Olric as unavailable.

### Check 1: WireGuard packet loss between nodes

SSH into each node and ping the other namespace nodes over WireGuard:

```bash
ping -c 10 -W 2 10.0.0.X   # replace with the WG IP of each peer
```

If you see packet loss over WireGuard but **not** over the public IP (`ping <public-ip>`), the WireGuard peer session is corrupted.

**This should no longer be needed.** The 60s peer sync now re-applies any peer
whose endpoint or allowed IPs drifted from what cluster membership says, and
persists the result to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`. A peer whose public IP moved
converges on its own within a minute. If you still have to reset a peer by hand,
that is a bug worth filing rather than a routine fix.

Check what the node believes before reaching for `wg set`:

```bash
# what the interface holds, with endpoints (machine-readable)
wg show wg0 dump

# what membership says it should hold
sudo grep -A3 '\[Peer\]' /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

# the sync's own account of the last round
sudo orama node logs node --since -10min | grep 'WireGuard peer sync completed' | tail -3
```

The sync log line reports `added`, `updated`, `removed` and `persisted`
separately. `persisted=false` means the mesh is correct **now** but will regress
on the next `wg-quick up` — a different problem from a peer that never reached
the interface.

**Break-glass reset (both sides), if you genuinely need it:**

```bash
# On Node A — replace <pubkey> and <endpoint> with Node B's values
wg set wg0 peer <NodeB-pubkey> remove
wg set wg0 peer <NodeB-pubkey> endpoint <NodeB-public-ip>:51820 allowed-ips <NodeB-wg-ip>/32 persistent-keepalive 25

# On Node B — same but with Node A's values
wg set wg0 peer <NodeA-pubkey> remove
wg set wg0 peer <NodeA-pubkey> endpoint <NodeA-public-ip>:51820 allowed-ips <NodeA-wg-ip>/32 persistent-keepalive 25
```

The next sync round re-persists whatever the interface ends up holding, so you
do not need to edit `wg0.conf` by hand.

### Check 2: Olric bound to 0.0.0.0 instead of WireGuard IP

Check the Olric config on each node:

```bash
cat /opt/orama/.orama/data/namespaces/<name>/configs/olric-*.yaml
```

If `bindAddr` is `0.0.0.0`, the node will try to bind to IPv6 on dual-stack hosts, breaking memberlist gossip.

**Fix:** Edit the YAML to use the node's WireGuard IP (run `ip addr show wg0` to find it), then restart: `sudo orama node restart`

This was fixed in code (BindAddr validation in `SpawnOlric`), so new namespaces won't have this issue.

### Check 3: Olric logs show "Failed UDP ping" constantly

```bash
sudo orama node logs orama-namespace-olric@<name> -n 30
```

If every UDP ping fails but TCP stream connections succeed, it's the WireGuard packet loss issue (see Check 1).

## 2. Namespace Gateway: Missing config fields

**Symptom:** Gateway config YAML is missing `global_rqlite_dsn`, has `olric_timeout: 0s`, or `olric_servers` only lists `localhost`.

**Cause:** Before the spawn handler fix, `spawnGatewayRemote()` didn't send `global_rqlite_dsn` or `olric_timeout` to remote nodes.

**Fix:** Edit the gateway config manually:

```bash
vim /opt/orama/.orama/data/namespaces/<name>/configs/gateway-*.yaml
```

Add/fix:
```yaml
global_rqlite_dsn: "http://10.0.0.X:10001"
olric_timeout: 30s
olric_servers:
  - "10.0.0.X:10002"
  - "10.0.0.Y:10002"
  - "10.0.0.Z:10002"
```

Then: `sudo orama node restart`

This was fixed in code, so new namespaces get the correct config.

---

## 3. Namespace not restoring after restart (missing cluster-state.json)

**Symptom:** After `orama node restart`, the namespace services don't come back because `RestoreLocalClustersFromDisk` has no state file.

**Check:**

```bash
ls /opt/orama/.orama/data/namespaces/<name>/cluster-state.json
```

If the file doesn't exist, the node can't restore the namespace **from disk** —
but that is no longer terminal. The disk pass runs once at boot for speed; the
tenant reconciler then converges from the database every 60s, so a node with no
state file recovers as soon as its rqlite has a leader.

Before this, the boot restore tried the database twelve times and gave up. A
node whose cluster had no leader for two minutes left every tenant down until
someone restarted the gateway by hand.

**Fix:** Create the file manually from another node that has it, or reconstruct it. The format is:

```json
{
  "namespace": "<name>",
  "rqlite": { "http_port": 10001, "raft_port": 10000, ... },
  "olric": { "http_port": 10002, "memberlist_port": 10003, ... },
  "gateway": { "http_port": 10004, ... }
}
```

This was fixed in code — `ProvisionCluster` now saves state to all nodes (including remote ones via the `save-cluster-state` spawn action).

**The state file is no longer trusted for raft membership.** `cluster-state.json`
is refreshed by a best-effort push, so the node most likely to hold a stale copy
is exactly the one that was down while the cluster changed. On restore, the peer
list written into `peers.json` (rqlite's force-recovery mechanism) now comes from:

1. **live membership in the index DB** when it is readable — authoritative, and
   it outranks anything on local disk;
2. **nothing at all** when the DB is unreadable but another member answers on
   its raft port — rqlited rejoins using its own raft state, and writing a guess
   would overwrite the real configuration;
3. **a single-node entry for this node** only when the DB is unreadable *and*
   no peer answers. That produces a working leader instead of a Candidate; the
   other members must be re-added once they return.

The state file is still used for everything else about the restore (ports, local
IP, WebRTC roles) — just not for asserting who the voters are.

---

## 4. Namespace gateway processes not restarting after upgrade

**Symptom:** After `orama node upgrade --restart` or `orama node restart`, namespace gateway/olric/rqlite services don't start.

**Cause:** `orama node stop` disables systemd template services (`orama-namespace-gateway@<name>.service`). They have `PartOf=orama-node.service`, but that only propagates restart to **enabled** services. Index host units (`@index`) are started by the supervisor on node start and do not need to be enabled.

**Fix:** `sudo orama node restart` — the upgrade orchestrator re-enables `@`
services before restarting them, so nothing has to be enabled by hand.

If you are on a node old enough not to do that, re-enable the tenant services
first. Raw `systemctl` bypasses the CLI's dependency ordering, quorum checks and
health verification, so this is a last resort, not a routine step:

```bash
systemctl enable orama-namespace-rqlite@<name>.service
systemctl enable orama-namespace-olric@<name>.service
systemctl enable orama-namespace-gateway@<name>.service
sudo orama node restart
```

If a tenant service is still down after that, the tenant reconciler restarts it
within a minute; it no longer needs a hand-run restore. A service that stays
down across several sweeps is a real failure — check its unit's logs rather than
re-running the commands above.

## 5. SSH commands eating stdin inside heredocs

**Symptom:** When running a script that SSHes into multiple nodes inside a heredoc (`<<'EOS'`), only the first SSH command runs — the rest are silently skipped.

**Cause:** `ssh` reads from stdin, consuming the rest of the heredoc.

**Fix:** Add `-n` flag to all `ssh` calls inside heredocs:

```bash
ssh -n user@host 'command'
```

`scp` is not affected (doesn't read stdin).

---

---

## 6. RQLite returns 401 Unauthorized

**Symptom:** RQLite queries fail with HTTP 401.

**Cause:** `rqlited` is started with `-auth` only when `database.rqlite_enforce_auth` is set, which is off by default. Two possibilities:

1. **Enforcement is off** (the normal state) — then the 401 is not Orama's. Something else is in front of RQLite: a reverse proxy, or a hand-edited unit file.
2. **Enforcement was switched on** while some caller still has no credentials.

**Fix:**

```bash
grep -E 'rqlite_(auth_file|enforce_auth|username|password)' /opt/orama/.orama/configs/node.yaml
```

If `rqlite_enforce_auth: true`, every client must send the credentials from `/opt/orama/.orama/secrets/rqlite-auth.json`. The node's own admin calls do (`core/pkg/rqlite/adminclient.go` reads `rqlite_auth_file`), and so does its SQL DSN. **The gateway and namespace DSNs do not** — `gateway.Config.RQLiteUsername`/`RQLitePassword` are never assigned — so enforcement is not yet safe to switch on fleet-wide.

Errors from `AdminClient` name a 401 explicitly ("rqlite rejected the credentials (401)"). A 401 that reads instead as reconciliation or backups silently stopping means some caller is still bypassing `AdminClient`.

**Enabling enforcement is two passes, in this order** (doing them in one 401s every peer still on the old binary — see `docs/SECURITY.md`):

1. Roll out configs carrying `rqlite_auth_file`, enforcement off, to **every** node.
2. Only then set `rqlite_enforce_auth: true`, restarting followers first and the leader last.

## 7. Olric cluster split after upgrade

**Symptom:** Olric nodes can't gossip after enabling memberlist encryption.

**Cause:** Olric memberlist encryption is all-or-nothing. Nodes with encryption can't communicate with nodes without it.

**Fix:** All nodes must be restarted simultaneously when enabling Olric encryption. The cache will be lost (it rebuilds from DB). This is expected — Olric is a cache, not persistent storage.

---

## 8. OramaOS: LUKS unlock fails

**Symptom:** OramaOS node can't reconstruct its LUKS key after reboot.

**Cause:** Not enough peer vault-guardians are online to meet the Shamir threshold (K = max(2, floor(N/3))).

**Fix:** Ensure enough cluster nodes are online and reachable over WireGuard. The agent retries with exponential backoff. For genesis nodes before 5+ peers exist, use:

```bash
orama node unlock --genesis --node-ip <wg-ip>
```

---

## 9. OramaOS: Enrollment timeout

**Symptom:** `orama node enroll` hangs or times out.

**Cause:** The OramaOS node's port 9999 isn't reachable, or the Gateway can't reach the node's WebSocket.

**Fix:** Check that port 9999 is open in your VPS provider's external firewall (Hetzner firewall, AWS security groups, etc.). OramaOS opens it internally, but provider-level firewalls must be configured separately.

---

## 10. Binary signature verification fails

**Symptom:** `orama node install` rejects the binary archive with a signature error.

**Cause:** The archive was tampered with, or the manifest.sig file is missing/corrupted.

**Fix:** Rebuild the archive with `orama build` and re-sign with `make sign` (in the orama-os repo). Ensure you're using the rootwallet that matches the embedded signer address.

---

## 11. Function WASM timeouts / deploy 504 after node replace (bugboard #167)

**Symptom:**

- `failed to fetch WASM: wasm fetch from IPFS timed out` (~15s) on invoke after a nameserver replace or rolling restart
- Other functions still succeed in milliseconds (different CIDs already local)
- `orama function deploy` returns **504** / `TIMEOUT` / “proxy budget (30s)” while gateway health still shows `ipfs: ok`

**Cause:** Function **metadata** is in namespace RQLite; function **bytes** are IPFS blobs. A **new or wiped node** starts with an empty Kubo repo. Until every active `wasm_cid` is **locally pinned** (bitswap from peers), cold `cat`/`add` can hang under hard deadlines. Health checks only prove the daemon is up.

**Fix:** Follow **IPFS function-WASM backfill** in [NODE_REPLACEMENT.md](NODE_REPLACEMENT.md): export active CIDs from the namespace RQLite, `pin/add` on **every** nameserver, verify `cat` + ~1.2 MB `add` on the new node. Do not treat platform Raft 3/3 alone as cutover complete.

---

## 12. IPFS-Cluster: node starts but its pins never replicate

**Symptom:** `ipfs-cluster` is running and `/v1/health` reports `ipfs: ok`, but
content pinned on this node never appears on the others (or vice versa). The
ipfs-cluster log shows only generic connection failures to peers.

**Cause:** the shared secret differs from the rest of the fleet. It is the key to
the cluster's libp2p **private network**, so a node holding a different value
completes no handshake with any peer — while looking healthy to every local
check.

**Check:** compare the first characters across nodes (never paste the whole
value into a ticket):

```bash
sudo head -c 8 /opt/orama/.orama/secrets/cluster-secret; echo
```

They must be identical on every node.

**Fix:** copy the value from a healthy node and restart `orama-node`. The join
handshake distributes this secret, so a node that joined properly has the right
one.

**This should no longer happen on its own.** The node used to generate a fresh
secret whenever the file could not be read (permissions, a transient I/O error,
a file the join handshake had not written yet) or was not exactly 64 characters,
and it discarded write errors — so a failed write produced a *different* secret
on each restart. It now refuses to start ipfs-cluster in all of those cases and
says why. A secret is generated only when the file is genuinely absent **and**
the node holds no ipfs-cluster identity, i.e. it has never joined a cluster.

## 13. RootWallet agent: locked, waiting, or unreachable

Commands that need an SSH key or a wallet signature — `orama node setup`,
`orama push`, `orama auth approve` — talk to the RootWallet desktop app's agent
over a Unix socket at `~/.rootwallet/agent.sock`. Override the path with
`RW_AGENT_SOCK`.

`orama auth login` uses the agent when it is reachable and does not need it when
it is not: on a machine with no wallet it prints a code and waits for
`orama auth approve <code>` on one that has. So "the agent is unreachable" is a
reason to approve from elsewhere rather than a reason the login cannot happen.

The agent answers with a code, and the CLI turns each one into an instruction:

| Code | What happened | What to do |
|------|---------------|------------|
| `AGENT_LOCKED` (423) | A vault operation waited for an unlock and gave up | Unlock the desktop app and run the command again |
| `AGENT_LOCKED` (401) | A wallet operation refused at once; these do not wait | Unlock the desktop app first, then run the command |
| `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` | The approval prompt went unanswered for two minutes | Run it again and approve it |
| `APPROVAL_DENIED` | Someone refused the request | Approve this application in the desktop app |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | The application lacks the capability | Grant it under app permissions |
| `PEER_VANISHED` | The `orama` binary changed while the request was open | Run it again |
| `NOT_FOUND` | No such vault entry | Nothing to do; the CLI creates SSH entries on demand |

**A first run against a locked wallet can take four minutes.** The agent waits
up to two minutes for approval, then up to two more for the unlock, and the CLI
waits longer than both so the agent's own answer arrives instead of a timeout
from this side. If `orama node setup` seems to hang, look at the desktop app:
there is probably a prompt on it. `orama sandbox` reports how many prompts are
waiting.

**"rootwallet agent is not reachable"** means the socket is not there: the
desktop app is closed. Open it.

## General Debugging Tips

- **Always use `sudo orama node restart`** instead of raw `systemctl` commands
- **Namespace data lives at:** `/opt/orama/.orama/data/namespaces/<name>/`
- **Check service logs:** `sudo orama node logs orama-namespace-olric@<name>` — it wraps `journalctl`, resolves template instances, and takes `-n` and `-f`
- **Check WireGuard:** `wg show wg0` — look for recent handshakes and transfer bytes
- **Check gateway health:** `curl http://localhost:<port>/v1/health` from the node itself
- **Node IPs:** `orama nodes --env <env>` lists them from the network API. The local fallback inventory is `nodes.conf`, looked for in the working directory, then `../scripts/`, then `~/.orama/` — see [INSPECTOR.md](INSPECTOR.md#configuration) for the full search order. `wg show wg0` for WG IPs. SSH keys come from the RootWallet vault, never from a file.
- **OramaOS nodes:** No SSH access — use Gateway API endpoints (`/v1/node/status`, `/v1/node/logs`) for diagnostics

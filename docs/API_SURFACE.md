# Gateway API surface

Every route the gateway registers, and which client owns it. The point is that
the TypeScript SDK's coverage is a decision rather than an accident: it reaches
35 of 136 routes, and the other 101 are here with a reason.

`core/pkg/gateway/api_surface_test.go` keeps this document honest in both
directions. A route registered in the gateway and missing here fails the Go
build; so does a route documented here that is no longer registered. Adding a
route therefore means deciding who calls it.

| Owner | Meaning | Count |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `SDK` | `@debros/orama` calls it | 35 |
| `CLI` | The `orama` CLI calls it. An application has no reason to: deploying, minting keys and managing nodes are operator actions. | 59 |
| `direct` | Reachable by a client, but not through the SDK by design. The reason is in the row. | 22 |
| `internal` | Node-to-node over the WireGuard overlay. Never reachable by a client. | 20 |

The request and response shapes of the `SDK` routes are pinned by the fixtures
in [`contracts/`](../contracts), which both a Go handler test and a TypeScript
unit test read, so a shape change on either side fails without a cluster.

### Health and version

| Route | Owner | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `/.well-known/jwks.json` | direct | JWKS for verifying gateway-issued JWTs. Read by other services, not by an application. |
| `/health` | SDK | `network.health()` |
| `/status` | direct | Gateway process status. `network.status()` uses `/v1/network/status`. |
| `/v1/health` | direct | Same as `/health`, kept for older callers. |
| `/v1/schema-status` | CLI | Migration state, polled during provisioning. |
| `/v1/status` | direct | Same as `/status`, kept for older callers. |
| `/v1/version` | CLI | Build version. `orama version` and the upgrade checks read it. |

### Authentication

| Route | Owner | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `/v1/auth/api-key` | SDK | `auth.getApiKey()` |
| `/v1/auth/challenge` | SDK | `auth.challenge()` |
| `/v1/auth/device` | CLI | Starts a login from a machine with no wallet on it (RFC 8628). Returns a device code the machine polls with and a short code the human approves. `orama auth login` on a server or in CI. |
| `/v1/auth/device/approve` | CLI | Approves — or, with `deny`, refuses — a pending device login. Costs a wallet signature over the gateway's own challenge, exactly as `/v1/auth/verify` does. `orama auth approve <code>`. |
| `/v1/auth/device/token` | CLI | The waiting machine's poll. Answers `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`, `expired_token` or `access_denied` until it is approved, then returns the session once. |
| `/v1/auth/jwks` | direct | JWKS. See `/.well-known/jwks.json`. |
| `/v1/auth/logout` | SDK | `auth.logout()` |
| `/v1/auth/refresh` | SDK | Session renewal, called by the client on a 401. |
| `/v1/auth/renew` | SDK | A deployment renewing its own workload token with the token it is holding. Refuses anything that is not a workload token. |
| `/v1/auth/sessions` | CLI | The live sessions signed in as the calling wallet. Never returns a refresh token. `orama auth sessions`. |
| `/v1/auth/sessions/` | CLI | `DELETE /v1/auth/sessions/{id}` ends one session. An access token already minted from it keeps working until it expires. `orama auth sessions revoke <id>`. |
| `/v1/auth/token` | direct | Exchange an API key for a JWT. A server-side concern; the SDK sends the key itself. |
| `/v1/auth/verify` | SDK | `auth.verify()` |
| `/v1/auth/whoami` | SDK | `auth.whoami()` |
| `/v1/audit` | CLI | The namespace's record of who was given what and when. Admin grant; the namespace comes from the credential, never the query string. `?action=`, `?principal=`, `?since=` and `?limit=` narrow it (50 by default, 200 at most). `orama audit [--follow]`. |

# TypeScript SDK

`@debros/orama` is the programmatic surface of an Orama namespace. Everything a
deployed application does — query its database, publish to a topic, cache a
value, store a file, invoke a function — goes through one client against one
gateway URL.

There is also a Go client, documented in [GO_CLIENT_SDK.md](GO_CLIENT_SDK.md).
It talks to the same gateway. Use whichever matches the code you are writing.

The SDK reaches a deliberate subset of the gateway: deploying an application,
minting a key and managing nodes are the CLI's job. Every route and its owner is
listed in [API_SURFACE.md](API_SURFACE.md).

The vault is **not** in this package. See [Secrets](#secrets) below.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install @debros/orama
```

The package ships ESM and CommonJS, so both `import` and `require` work, in
Node and in a browser bundle. Node 20 or later.

---

## The client

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@debros/orama";

const client = createClient({
  baseURL: "https://ns-myapp.orama-devnet.network",
  apiKey: process.env.ORAMA_API_KEY,
});
```

`createClient` returns one object with a member per module:

| Member | What it reaches |
|--------|-----------------|
| `client.auth` | Credentials, wallet login, session renewal |
| `client.db` | The namespace's RQLite database |
| `client.pubsub` | Topics, over HTTP to publish and WebSocket to subscribe |
| `client.cache` | The Olric distributed cache |
| `client.storage` | IPFS upload, pin and retrieve |
| `client.functions` | Serverless WASM function invocation |
| `client.network` | Gateway health, cluster status, peers, and the anonymity proxy |

### ClientConfig

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `baseURL` | `string` | — | Gateway URL. Required. |
| `apiKey` | `string` | — | API key, `orama_<type>_<payload>_<checksum>`. Exchanged for a token before the first request; the key itself never goes on the wire again |
| `jwt` | `string` | — | An existing session token |
| `timeout` | `number` | `60000` | Per-request timeout in milliseconds |
| `maxRetries` | `number` | `3` | Attempts for a retryable status (408, 429, 5xx) |
| `retryDelayMs` | `number` | `1000` | Base backoff, multiplied by the attempt and jittered |
| `debug` | `boolean` | `false` | Print diagnostics. With it off the SDK writes nothing to the console. |
| `storage` | `StorageAdapter` | `MemoryStorage` | Where tokens are persisted |
| `wsConfig` | `Partial<WSClientConfig>` | — | WebSocket options, including `reconnect` |
| `functionsConfig` | `FunctionsClientConfig` | — | `namespace`, and an optional separate `gatewayURL` |
| `fetch` | `typeof fetch` | the platform's | Replace the fetch used for every request |
| `onNetworkError` | `NetworkErrorCallback` | — | Called when a request fails to reach the gateway |

---

## Where a key belongs

An API key carries grants, and a key in a browser bundle is a key in the hands
of everyone who loads the page. The split the gateway enforces:

- **Server-side only** — an `admin` key. It reaches the control plane: deploys,
  secrets, migrations, key management, raw RQLite. It belongs in CI and on a
  developer's machine, never in anything a browser downloads.
- **Safe in a client bundle** — an `app-runtime` key. Data-plane grants only,
  and the gateway additionally requires a logged-in user's wallet JWT for
  storage, WebRTC and proxy operations, so an extracted runtime key on its own
  cannot act as anybody.

```bash
orama namespace keys create --scope app-runtime --label web
orama namespace keys create --scope admin --label ci
```

In a browser, obtain the user's JWT with the wallet flow below and let the
runtime key handle the rest. In a server process, read the key from the
environment; do not commit it.

---

## Authentication

### One credential, one header

Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and nothing else. The SDK
used to choose between `X-API-Key` and `Authorization` by looking at the path —
three spellings, and the raw key on every request. There is one now.

### API key

```typescript
const client = createClient({ baseURL, apiKey: process.env.ORAMA_API_KEY });
```

The key is **exchanged once**, before the first request, for a 15-minute token
carrying the key's own grants. Every request after that carries the token, and
the SDK exchanges again before it expires and once more if the gateway says the
token has expired. So the key stays in the process it was given to: it is not in
an access log, a proxy trace, a devtools tab or a WebSocket URL.

You do not have to do anything for this. It is why `getToken()` returns a token
rather than the key you configured.

### A deployed app

An app running on Orama is handed a token of its own, in the file named by
`$ORAMA_TOKEN_FILE`, and holds no key at all:

```typescript
import { createWorkloadClient } from "@debros/orama";

const client = await createWorkloadClient();
```

It reads `ORAMA_GATEWAY_URL` and `ORAMA_TOKEN_FILE` from the environment the
platform set up, and renews the token before it expires. What it may reach is
whatever `orama app grants set <app> …` gave it — nothing, until you do.

### Wallet login

A user proves ownership of an address by signing a Sign-In with Ethereum
message (EIP-4361), or its Solana counterpart for `chain_type: "SOL"`. The
result is a JWT scoped to the namespace.

```typescript
const challenge = await client.auth.challenge({
  wallet: "0xYourWallet",
  namespace: "acme",
  chain_type: "ETH", // or "SOL"
});

// Sign the message verbatim. It is what the wallet shows the user, and the
// gateway verifies the signature against the exact text it issued.
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(challenge.message);

const session = await client.auth.verify({
  message: challenge.message,
  signature,
});
```

The message carries the gateway's domain, the namespace, the nonce and a
five-minute expiry, and the signature covers all of it. That is what makes the
signature a login *here* rather than a credential anyone who sees it can use
anywhere — so `verify` takes the message, not the fields beside it: the wallet
and namespace it acts on are read out of the bytes the user approved.

`verify` stores the access token, the refresh token and the namespace the token
was issued for, so renewal below happens on its own. Challenges are single-use:
ask for a fresh one for each call.

`client.auth.getApiKey({ message, signature })` mints a long-lived key the same
way, from its own fresh challenge.

### Sessions renew themselves

When the gateway answers 401 and a refresh token is stored, the SDK renews the
session and replays the request once. The application does not see the 401.
Concurrent requests that expire together share a single renewal.

```typescript
await client.auth.logout();                     // tell the gateway, clear everything
await client.auth.logout({ keepApiKey: true }); // the user signs out, the app key stays
await client.auth.logout({ server: false });    // clear local state only
```

`client.auth.whoami()` answers `{ authenticated: false }` for a rejected
credential and **throws** for anything else, so a gateway that is down is not
reported as a signed-out user.

`client.auth.getToken()` returns the credential that would be sent as a Bearer
token: the JWT when one is set, otherwise the API key.

### Persisting tokens in a browser

```typescript
import { createClient, LocalStorageAdapter } from "@debros/orama";

const client = createClient({ baseURL, apiKey, storage: new LocalStorageAdapter() });
```

---

## Database

The namespace's RQLite database, reached four ways depending on how much
structure you want.

```typescript
// Raw SQL
const rows = await client.db.query("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE room = ?", ["general"]);
await client.db.exec("INSERT INTO messages (room, body) VALUES (?, ?)", ["general", "hi"]);

// Criteria
const recent = await client.db.find("messages", { room: "general" }, { limit: 20 });
const one = await client.db.findOne("messages", { id: 42 }); // null when absent

// Query builder
const page = await client.db
  .createQueryBuilder("messages")
  .where("room = ?", ["general"])
  .orderBy("created_at DESC")
  .limit(20)
  .getMany();

// Repository
const messages = client.db.repository<Message>("messages");
await messages.save({ room: "general", body: "hi" });
```

A row that is not there is `null` from both `findOne` methods, never an
exception.

Table, primary-key and column names are validated as plain SQL identifiers.
Values are parameterised; identifiers cannot be, so a name that is not
`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` is rejected with `INVALID_IDENTIFIER` rather than
interpolated into the statement.

---

## Pub/sub

```typescript
await client.pubsub.publish("room:general", "hello");
await client.pubsub.publish("room:general", new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));

const subscription = await client.pubsub.subscribe("room:general", {
  onMessage: (msg) => {
    msg.data;      // the payload decoded as UTF-8 text
    msg.bytes;     // the payload exactly as published
    msg.timestamp; // server-assigned, so ordering does not depend on client clocks
  },
  onError: (error) => report(error),
  onClose: () => teardown(),
});

subscription.close();
```

`data` is lossy for a payload that is not text: bytes that do not form valid
UTF-8 become U+FFFD. Read `bytes` for anything binary.

A dropped connection is re-established with exponential backoff — ten attempts
by default — and the subscription resumes on the new socket. `onClose` fires
only when the subscription is finished for good, so it is not raised for a drop
that is about to be repaired. Configure or disable it with
`wsConfig.reconnect`.

Presence is opt-in per subscription:

```typescript
await client.pubsub.subscribe("room:general", {
  presence: {
    enabled: true,
    memberId: userId,
    onJoin: (member) => show(member),
    onLeave: (member) => hide(member),
  },
});
```

---

## Cache

```typescript
await client.cache.put("sessions", userId, { seen: Date.now() }, "1h");

const hit = await client.cache.get("sessions", userId); // null on a miss
if (hit) console.log(hit.value);

await client.cache.delete("sessions", userId);
```

The distributed map name is the first argument; keys are scoped to it. The TTL
is a duration string such as `"30m"` or `"1h"`, and is optional.

---

## Storage

```typescript
const { cid } = await client.storage.upload(file, file.name);
const status = await client.storage.status(cid);

const stream = await client.storage.get(cid);       // ReadableStream
const response = await client.storage.getBinary(cid); // Response, with headers

await client.storage.unpin(cid);
```

A read that closely follows a write can legitimately 404 while the pin
propagates across the cluster, so reads retry on 404 for about eighteen seconds
before giving up. Any other failure is returned immediately.

---

## Functions

```typescript
const client = createClient({
  baseURL,
  apiKey,
  functionsConfig: { namespace: "myapp" },
});

const result = await client.functions.invoke("resize", { cid, width: 400 });
```

Set `functionsConfig.gatewayURL` to send invocations to a different origin with
the same credentials. Writing and deploying functions is covered in
[SERVERLESS.md](SERVERLESS.md).

---

## Cancelling work

Every request method takes an `AbortSignal`.

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const search = client.db.query("SELECT * FROM big_table", [], {
  signal: controller.signal,
});

controller.abort(); // rejects with a NetworkError whose code is "ABORTED"
```

A cancelled request is never retried and is not reported through
`onNetworkError`: pressing Cancel is not a network failure.

---

## Errors

Every failure is an `SDKError`, so one `catch` covers the SDK. The subclasses
name the cases an application usually handles differently:

| Class | When | Extra |
|-------|------|-------|
| `AuthError` | 401 — credential missing, expired, or not enough alone | `requiredScope` |
| `RevokedCredentialError` | 401 with `AUTH_REVOKED` — the answer is "sign in again", not "retry" | |
| `ScopeError` | 403 — the credential's grants do not cover the operation | `requiredScope` |
| `NamespaceError` | 403 with `NAMESPACE_MISMATCH` — the client is pointed at the wrong gateway, or the key came from the wrong environment | `namespace`, `credentialNamespace` |
| `NotFoundError` | 404 | |
| `NetworkError` | No HTTP response at all. `httpStatus` is always 0 | `code` is `NETWORK_ERROR`, `TIMEOUT` or `ABORTED` |

`error.code` is the gateway's own; every code is listed in [AUTH.md](AUTH.md).
`Scope` and `Role` are exported as types, so a grant name that does not exist is
a compile error rather than a 403 in production.

```typescript
import { NetworkError, ScopeError } from "@debros/orama";

try {
  await client.storage.upload(file, file.name);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ScopeError) {
    console.error(`this key needs the ${error.requiredScope} grant`);
  } else if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
    console.error("the gateway was not reached");
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

`httpStatus` of 0 is how "never reached the gateway" is told apart from a real
4xx or 5xx.

### Grants

```typescript
import { SCOPES, PROFILE_SCOPES, satisfiesScope } from "@debros/orama";

PROFILE_SCOPES["app-runtime"]; // ["invoke", "storage", "push", "webrtc", "proxy"]
satisfiesScope(["admin"], "storage"); // true — admin is a wildcard
```

The grants are `admin`, `cache`, `invoke`, `proxy`, `pubsub`, `push`, `storage`
and `webrtc`. They mirror the gateway's own list, and a test in the SDK fails if
the two ever disagree.

---

## Retries and failover

A retryable status (408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) is retried up to `maxRetries`
times. A `Retry-After` header is honoured, capped at thirty seconds; otherwise
the delay grows with the attempt and carries up to 25% jitter so clients that
failed together do not return together.

Failing over to another gateway is the application's decision, and
`onNetworkError` is where to make it:

```typescript
const client = createClient({
  baseURL: gateways[0],
  apiKey,
  onNetworkError: (error, context) => {
    if (error.httpStatus === 0) rotateGateway(context.path);
  },
});
```

---

## Secrets

The vault client is a separate package, `@debros/orama-vault`. It talks to
guardian daemons on the WireGuard overlay, which an application outside the
cluster cannot reach.

An application reaches the vault through the gateway's `/v1/vault/push` and
`/v1/vault/pull` endpoints over HTTPS, which do the Shamir split server-side and
authenticate each request with a per-request Ed25519 ownership signature. See
[vault/SECURITY_MODEL.md](vault/SECURITY_MODEL.md).

---

## Reaching a gateway with an untrusted certificate

A test cluster may present a certificate your runtime does not trust. Supply a
`fetch` that relaxes verification **for that connection only**:

```typescript
import { Agent, fetch as undiciFetch } from "undici";

const dispatcher = new Agent({ connect: { rejectUnauthorized: false } });
const client = createClient({
  baseURL,
  apiKey,
  fetch: (input, init) =>
    undiciFetch(input, { ...init, dispatcher }) as unknown as Promise<Response>,
});
```

The SDK never changes the process's TLS settings on your behalf: doing so would
disable certificate verification for every other HTTPS client in the same
process.

---

## Testing against a gateway

The SDK's own end-to-end suite runs only when it has a gateway to talk to:

```bash
export GATEWAY_BASE_URL=https://ns-myapp.orama-devnet.network
export GATEWAY_API_KEY=ak_test:myapp
pnpm test:e2e
```

Without `GATEWAY_API_KEY` those tests report as skipped. The unit suite needs
nothing.

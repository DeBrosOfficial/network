// Package raftid performs the one-time move from address-derived raft node ids
// to stable, peer-id-based ones.
//
// rqlite defaults a node's raft id to its raft advertise address, so identity
// has been a function of routing: give the same machine a new overlay address
// and it mints a new raft id, joins as a second member, and the old entry stays
// in the configuration as a voter nothing can reach. Two such events on a
// five-voter cluster leave quorum at 3-of-7 with five live voters.
//
// rqlite has no way to rename a member in place — the only supported paths are
// remove-then-rejoin, or the peers.json disaster procedure — so this cannot be
// a side effect of an upgrade. A node that simply started passing -node-id
// would join as a NEW member and leave its old id behind: the exact failure the
// change exists to prevent, applied to every node at once. Hence a deliberate,
// serial, quorum-checked migration, one node at a time.

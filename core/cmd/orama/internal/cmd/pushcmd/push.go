// Package pushcmd defines the push command.
//
// The same command is mounted as `orama push` and as `orama node push`. They
// used to be separate implementations: this one uploaded sequentially unless
// --fanout was given, the other fanned out unless --direct was given, and their
// fanouts differed in how each target's key reached the hub. Same command name,
// opposite default, two security models.

By default the archive is uploaded once to a hub node, which then distributes
it to the others server-to-server. Use --direct to upload from this machine to
each node in turn.

'orama push' and 'orama node push' are the same command.

Examples:
  orama push --env devnet             # Fan out across the devnet nodes
  orama push --env devnet --direct    # Upload to each node in turn
  orama push --env devnet --node 1.2.3.4
  orama push --host 1.2.3.4           # A node that is not in the inventory yet`,
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
			return push.Run(&flags)
		},

	f.StringVar(&flags.User, "user", "", "SSH user for --host (default: root)")
	f.BoolVar(&flags.Direct, "direct", false, "Upload from here to each node in turn, instead of fanning out")

	// --ip and --fanout are what the top-level command used to take. Fanning
	// out is now the default, so --fanout is accepted and ignored rather than
	// silently meaning the opposite of what it used to.
	f.StringVar(&flags.Host, "ip", "", "Deprecated: use --host")
	f.Bool("fanout", false, "Deprecated: fanning out is the default; use --direct to opt out")
	_ = f.MarkDeprecated("ip", "use --host")
	_ = f.MarkDeprecated("fanout", "fanning out is now the default; use --direct to opt out")

	return cmd

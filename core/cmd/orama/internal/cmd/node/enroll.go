The OramaOS node prints a registration code on its console. Provide that code
along with an invite token. The Gateway pushes cluster configuration
(WireGuard, secrets, peer list) to the node, sealed under the code.

The code is not served over the network. A GET on port 9999 used to return it.

Usage:
  orama node enroll --node-ip <ip> --code <code> --token <invite-token> --gateway <url>

The node must be reachable over the public internet on port 9999 (enrollment only).
After enrollment, port 9999 is permanently closed and all communication goes over WireGuard.`,

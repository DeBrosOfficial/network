// Rate limiting used to key on getClientIP, which returns the first entry of
// X-Forwarded-For. Anyone could send that header, and any address in the
// WireGuard subnet was exempt from every limit — so one header removed all
// rate limiting, including from the endpoints that mint credentials.
//
// The peer address is the only thing a caller cannot choose. X-Forwarded-For
// is honoured only when the peer is the local reverse proxy, and only its last
// entry: Caddy appends the address it is actually talking to, so the last entry
// is the real client and the ones before it are whatever the client claimed.
//
// Two things follow that are worth being explicit about, because getting either
// backwards would be worse than the bug:
//
//   - Loopback is not exempt when the request arrived through Caddy. Every
//     public request reaches the gateway from 127.0.0.1, so exempting loopback
//     after this fix would exempt the whole internet.
//   - Loopback with no forwarding header is a genuinely local caller — a
//     service on the node talking to the index gateway — and stays exempt.

// rateLimitClient returns the address to hold responsible for a request, and
// whether it is internal traffic exempt from limits.

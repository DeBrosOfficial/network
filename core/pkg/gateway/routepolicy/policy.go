// Package routepolicy is where a route says who may call it.
//
// Who may call what used to be three hand-maintained lists of path prefixes in
// the middleware — isPublicPath, requiredScope and requiresNamespaceOwnership —
// with nothing connecting any of them to the routes they described. A route
// could match none of them, or two that disagreed, and the only symptom was an
// endpoint answering the wrong thing to the wrong caller.
//
// That had already happened twice. /v1/node/enroll was exempted from the scope
// check because its handler validates a Bearer invite token, and never added to
// the public list — so the API-key middleware refused the invite token as a bad
// API key and enrolling a node could not work at all. /v1/operator/* matched
// none of the lists, so a key out of a public app bundle could mint a cluster
// invite.
//
// Here a policy is declared once, in a table, and the middleware reads the
// policy of the route the request actually matched — never the path string. A
// route with no declared policy cannot be registered.

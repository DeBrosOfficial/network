// HostFunctions provides the bridge between WASM functions and Orama services.
// It implements the HostServices interface and is injected into the execution
// context.
//
// It holds **no per-invocation state**. One of these exists for the life of the
// gateway and is shared by every invocation running on it, so anything about
// "the current invocation" kept here is a field two concurrent invocations
// overwrite for each other. It had two — the invocation context and the
// captured logs — and both produced exactly that: bugboard #348 was a
// cross-tenant identity leak through the first, and #108 was one invocation's
// log lines appearing in another's record through the second.
//
// Identity and logs ride the context instead, attached per invocation by the
// engine. A host call with no invocation on its context is a host call outside
// any invocation, and says so rather than picking up whoever ran last.

// Emits the agent-facing docs endpoint into the built site:
//   dist/llms.txt        — llmstxt.org index (what an LLM reads first)
//   dist/llms/<slug>.md  — raw markdown of each curated doc
//
// Source of truth is the repo-root docs/ tree (../../docs from here). We
// publish only the curated subset an agent building ON Orama needs — not the
// internal node-operations runbooks. Adding a doc to a project means adding a
// line here; a missing source file fails the build loudly (no silent skip).

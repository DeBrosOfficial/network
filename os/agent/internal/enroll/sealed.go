// Enrollment hands a booting node the cluster secret and its WireGuard
// configuration. That exchange used to happen over plaintext HTTP on the
// node's public IP, with no authentication in either direction:
//
//   - the node served its registration code to whoever asked first, so the
//     secret meant to prove the operator's identity was published;
//   - the config endpoint accepted any POST, so anyone who reached the node
//     first could enrol it into their own cluster, with their own WireGuard
//     peers;
//   - and the cluster secret crossed the network in the clear.
//
// The registration code is the only secret both ends share before the node is
// a member of anything, and the operator carries it from the node's console to
// the gateway. So it is what authenticates the exchange and what the payload is
// encrypted under. Successful decrypt is the proof: the code is not sent as a
// header, which used to put the seal key on the wire next to the ciphertext.
//
// Phase 1 of the auth redesign replaces this with a node principal credential
// issued at join. Until then this is a code the operator physically carried,
// used as a code should be.

/**
 * @debros/orama-vault — client for the Orama Network vault guardians.
 *
 * This is operator and RootWallet tooling, not application tooling. The
 * guardians listen on the WireGuard overlay (`10.0.0.x`), so an application
 * running outside the cluster cannot reach them at all. Applications that need
 * secrets should use the gateway's `/v1/vault/{push,pull}` endpoints, which are
 * reachable over HTTPS and do the same Shamir split server-side.
 *
 * It used to ship inside `@debros/orama`, where it added two cryptography
 * dependencies and twenty top-level primitives to every application's bundle
 * for an API none of them could call.

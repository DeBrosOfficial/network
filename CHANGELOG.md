## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

## [0.53.8] - 2025-10-31

### Added

- **HTTPS/ACME Support**: Gateway now supports automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates via ACME
  - Interactive domain configuration during `network-cli setup` command
  - Automatic port availability checking for ports 80 and 443 before enabling HTTPS
  - DNS resolution verification to ensure domain points to the server IP
  - TLS certificate cache directory management (`~/.debros/tls-cache`)
  - Gateway automatically serves HTTP (port 80) for ACME challenges and HTTPS (port 443) for traffic
  - New gateway config fields: `enable_https`, `domain_name`, `tls_cache_dir`
- **Domain Validation**: Added domain name validation and DNS verification helpers in setup CLI
- **Port Checking**: Added port availability checking utilities to detect conflicts before HTTPS setup

### Changed

- Updated `generateGatewayConfigDirect` to include HTTPS configuration fields
- Enhanced gateway config parsing to support HTTPS settings with validation
- Modified gateway startup to handle both HTTP-only and HTTPS+ACME modes
- Gateway now automatically manages ACME certificate acquisition and renewal

### Fixed

- Improved error handling during HTTPS setup with clear messaging when ports are unavailable
- Enhanced DNS verification flow with better user feedback during setup

## [0.53.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added

- Discovery manager now tracks failed peer-exchange attempts to suppress repeated warnings while peers negotiate supported protocols.

### Changed

- Scoped logging throughout `cluster_discovery`, `rqlite`, and `discovery` packages so logs carry component tags and keep verbose output at debug level.
- Refactored `ClusterDiscoveryService` membership handling: metadata updates happen under lock, `peers.json` is written outside the lock, self-health is skipped, and change detection is centralized in `computeMembershipChangesLocked`.
- Reworked `RQLiteManager.Start` into helper functions (`prepareDataDir`, `launchProcess`, `waitForReadyAndConnect`, `establishLeadershipOrJoin`) with clearer logging, better error handling, and exponential backoff while waiting for leadership.
- `validateNodeID` now treats empty membership results as transitional states, logging at debug level instead of warning to avoid noisy startups.

### Fixed

- Eliminated spurious `peers.json` churn and node-ID mismatch warnings during cluster formation by aligning IDs with raft addresses and tightening discovery logging.

## [0.52.15]

### Added

- Added Base64 encoding for the response body in the anonProxyHandler to prevent corruption of binary data when returned in JSON format.

### Changed

- **GoReleaser**: Updated to build only `network-cli` binary (v0.52.2+)
  - Other binaries (node, gateway, identity) now installed via `network-cli setup`
  - Cleaner, smaller release packages
  - Resolves archive mismatch errors
- **GitHub Actions**: Updated artifact actions from v3 to v4 (deprecated versions)

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- Fixed install script to be more clear and bug fixing

## [0.52.1] - 2025-10-26

### Added

- **CLI Refactor**: Modularized monolithic CLI into `pkg/cli/` package structure for better maintainability
  - New `environment.go`: Multi-environment management system (local, devnet, testnet)
  - New `env_commands.go`: Environment switching commands (`env list`, `env switch`, `devnet enable`, `testnet enable`)
  - New `setup.go`: Interactive VPS installation command (`network-cli setup`) that replaces bash install script
  - New `service.go`: Systemd service management commands (`service start|stop|restart|status|logs`)
  - New `auth_commands.go`, `config_commands.go`, `basic_commands.go`: Refactored commands into modular pkg/cli
- **Release Pipeline**: Complete automated release infrastructure via `.goreleaser.yaml` and GitHub Actions
  - Multi-platform binary builds (Linux/macOS, amd64/arm64)
  - Automatic GitHub Release creation with changelog and artifacts
  - Semantic versioning support with pre-release handling
- **Environment Configuration**: Multi-environment switching system
  - Default environments: local (http://localhost:6001), devnet (https://devnet.debros.network), testnet (https://testnet.debros.network)
  - Stored in `~/.debros/environments.json`
  - CLI auto-uses active environment for authentication and operations
- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - `.cursor/RELEASES.md`: Overview and quick start
  - `.cursor/goreleaser-guide.md`: Detailed distribution guide
  - `.cursor/release-checklist.md`: Quick reference

### Changed

- **CLI Refactoring**: `cmd/cli/main.go` reduced from 1340 â†’ 180 lines (thin router pattern)
  - All business logic moved to modular `pkg/cli/` functions
  - Easier to test, maintain, and extend individual commands
- **Installation**: `scripts/install-debros-network.sh` now APT-ready with fallback to source build
- **Setup Process**: Consolidated all installation logic into `network-cli setup` command
  - Single unified installation regardless of installation method
  - Interactive user experience with clear progress indicators
